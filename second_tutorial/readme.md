This will follow a machine learning workflow:

1. Data cleaning and formatting
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering and selection
4. Compare several machine learning models on a performance metric
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model
6. Evaluate the best model on the testing set
7. Interpret the best model results
8. Draw conclusions and document work

I used the following tutorial and I do not take credit for the code in this
project.
